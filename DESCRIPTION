Description: The package provides randomization for applications with many strata and provides additional features to randomize QC samples within batches.  A second function allows for the ability to ”switch” samples to meet set requirements and perform a certain amount of minimization on these switches.  The functions are flexible for users by specifying strata size and number of QC samples per strata.  The randomization meets the following requirements
    • QC sample requirements: QC samples not adjacent, QC
    samples from same mother must follow certain patterns.
    • Matched sample sets must be within a single strata, and next
    to each other.
